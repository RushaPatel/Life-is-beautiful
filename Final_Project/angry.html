<div><h1>Angry</h1>
    Although anger is a normal human emotion, it is often considered unhealthy and problematic, 
    and is also known to have counterproductive results. The experience of anger is indicative of
    the dissatisfaction we feel for the existing circumstances, and our want for something to change.
    Prolonged or chronic anger is when we experience anger for long enough for it to become a part 
    of our personality. This type of anger is also difficult to control and can be outside the 
    purview of self-help. However, when the anger is not so intense, we can try to practice some 
    techniques of self-control and relaxation to calm ourselves and not allow anger to have an 
    adverse effect on our body and mind.
    <br>

    <b>Anger can have the following manifestations in our body, mind and behavior:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Physical: Increased heart rate, increased blood pressure, sweating, flushed face, 
        tension in muscles and a clenched jaw. Some people also cry when they feel really angry</li>
        <li>Emotional/psychological: Feeling rejected, frustrated, hostile, alone, out of control</li>
        <li>Behavioral:  Screaming and shouting, hitting or punching, slamming doors, flinging 
        verbal abuses and heightened physical violence</li>
    </ul>
    The degree of sadness is something that can vary from one person to another.
    Some of us may find that we are able to do things to help ourselves feel better, while others may feel
    progressively deeper sadness. Sometimes, sadness when not dealt with can take deep root and may require 
    counseling.
    <br>
    <b>Below is a list of a few things we can do for ourselves to feel better. However, if the feeling of sadness is
    more severe or prolonged, professional help may be necessary.</b>
    <ul>
    <li>Exercise: Many studies have proved that when we exercise our bodies release endorphins or ‘happy’ hormones.
    This can help us in the process of fighting sadness. Exercising can also help with improving focus and creating new goals.</li>
    <li>Meditation and yoga: Both of these methods have been known to lessen the feeling of stress and sadness. 
    It may be a good idea to join group yoga classes to feel motivated to go every day.</li>
    <li>Acknowledgement and acceptance: Acknowledging our experience of sadness can often be the first step towards feeling better. 
    It can also be helpful to try having a non-judgmental acceptance of both, the challenges of life as well as, our reactions to them. 
    Acceptance can bring with it a feeling of empowerment and can give us the strength to begin afresh.</li>
    <li>Meeting friends and interacting with the outside world: The experience of sadness can reduce our motivation to leave the house. 
    However, sometimes interacting with friends and acquaintances can really help lift our mood.</li>
    <li>Finding ways to express sadness: Certain practices like writing a journal, drawing, painting, dancing or using any other form or
    art for creative expression can often offer some relief in the experience of sadness. Art forms are not just good outlets for pent up feelings but are also known to be extremely therapeutic.</li></ul>
    Sadness is a normal emotional response and there is nothing wrong with feeling this way. However, it is very important to recognize the extent of our sadness, and if this feeling does not get 
    any better despite our efforts, it is important to seek help.</div>
